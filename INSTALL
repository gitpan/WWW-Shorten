Installation Instructions

The instructions are basically as per any Perl module.


INSTALLING AUTOMATICALLY
------------------------

The easiest way to install is via CPAN or CPANPLUS:

CPAN:

    % perl -MCPAN -e shell                    [as root]
    > install WWW::Shorten
    > quit

CPANPLUS:

    % cpanp
    > i WWW::Shorten
    > q

See your local 'perldoc CPAN' or 'perldoc CPANPLUS' for
instructions on setting up and configuring CPAN or CPANPLUS.


OBTAINING THE MODULE
--------------------

The latest release version of WWW::Shorten can be downloaded
from any CPAN site:

    http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-authors/id/S/SP/SPOON/
    https://metacpan.org/release/WWW-Shorten/

Interim and development versions may also be available
from github:

    http://github.com/davorg/www-shorten

WWW::Shorten is distributed as a gzipped tar archive file:

    WWW-Shorten-<version>.tar.gz

where <version> represents the current version number, e.g. 1.88.

To install the module, unpack the distribution archive to
create an installation directory.  Something like this:

    tar zxf WWW-Shorten-1.88.tar.gz
or
    gunzip WWW-Shorten-1.88.tar.gz
    tar xf WWW-Shorten-1.88.tar

You can then 'cd' into the directory created,

    cd WWW-Shorten-1.88



INSTALLING MANUALLY
-------------------

The 'make install' (done later) will install the modules and scripts on
your system. You may need administrator privileges to perform this task.
Alternately you can install the module to a local directory (see
ExtUtils::MakeMaker for full details), e.g.

    % perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/home/abw/

Don't forget to update your PERL5LIB environment variable if you do
this, or add a line to your script to tell Perl where to find the files,
e.g.

    use lib qw( /home/abw/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.6.0 );

If you're not after a custom location, just do:

    % perl Makefile.PL

If you are lacking any of the prerequisite modules, running that
program will tell you. All prerequisites are available from CPAN.

When you have them all:

    % make && make test

If there are any failures, it's best if you contact me. It may help
other people who have the same problem.  I don't tend to read the Perl
newsgroups or PerlMonks, so it's no use posting there.

When you report your trouble, be sure to send me the following
information;
    + result of `perl -V'
    + output from 'make test' - ideally do 'make test TEST_VERBOSE=1 >& errs'

Send those to bug-WWW-Shorten@rt.cpan.org and I'll get
back to you as soon as I'm able.

If it worked, then become root and type:

    # make install

Congratulations. You've just installed WWW::Shorten.
