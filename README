WWW::Shorten version 1.3
========================

First there was MakeAShorterLink, which was renamed
WWW::MakeAShorterLink. Then, there was WWW::TinyURL.
Then, because there's these services all over the place, I
decided to create a generic interface and class for them.

WWW::Shorten is set of Perl modules which provide an API to
sites on the Internet that provide redirection services that
let you shorten URLs. Thus you can programmatically create
shorter URLs for links.
